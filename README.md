# Snaek, the game
this is probably my first bigger project in C++ that i'll ever finish (at least i still have an urge to do so)  
moving system currently works, but i'm pretty sure that i'll need to rebuild it from scratch after i actually program the snake's growing mechanism 
apparently you're just a blob in the nothingness with a never ending supply of dollar signs

# Garbage Controls
to move, type `W` `A` `S` `D` and then hit `ENTER` to confirm it  
(i can't detect live inputs yet, sadness)  

# Compiling
if you're willing to compile the *game* by yourself, use  
`g++ src/Main.cpp -o snaek(.exe)`
